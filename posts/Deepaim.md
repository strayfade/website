### What is deepaim?
Deepaim is an undetectable aimbot that can be adapted and used with practically any video game in existence. It is currently in production and has been used/tested (and meets our performance requirements) in the following games:

 - Apex Legends
 - Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
 - Fortnite
 - Halo Infinite

### How does deepaim work?
Deepaim first captures a section of the game screen, then runs inference on a deep neural network to recognize potential targets (enemy players, etc.). Using this data, we can tell what direction and how far we need to move the mouse to aim at the target.

### What's the catch?
AI aimbots are not a new concept, by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, AI aimbots have been continuously developed publicly in Python for 2-3 years at the time of writing. **But, knowing this, let's see how deepaim crushes the competition:**

 - Extremely fast and optimized with 200-300 frames per second on a mid-tier GPU (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti)
 - Auto-sensitivity (Other cheats may require you to input your sensitivity manually to move the mouse, but deepaim calibrates itself automatically.)
 - Customers have experienced **0 bans ever** as a result of using deepaim.
 - Easy to use in-game menu

### Where can I buy it? Can I get a free trial?
