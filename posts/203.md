# 203
### Non-Authoritative Information

This response code means the returned metadata is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource. Except for that specific case, the `200 OK` response is preferred to this status.
