### Introduction

So, as many of you may already know, my YouTube channel and online presence has strayed away from game-hacking, and I have become increasingly interested in music instead. There are a few reasons for this. First off, I really like the creative power and non-toxic community that arises from me creating music. In my opinion, creating music and getting mostly positive feedback is much better than creating game-hacking videos and receiving feedback in the form of _"What is `xinput1_3` and why can't I inject into CSGO?"_

I'm just kidding, of course, nobody writes comments with correct capitalization and punctuation.

### Why music?

Creating music gives me an amazing amount of opportunities to create and share tutorials with you all. Throughout the past years working with game-hacking while making music, I have learned some important things about the way that YouTube recommends videos, which will greatly help me when I decide to start releasing tutorials based around music. I can create multiple tutorials per day now, and I don't have to deal with many problems that are out of my control (except for FL Studio crashing, of course!)

As I've grown up with you all, I feel like I have learned a lot about what it takes to become successful online, and I'm ready to give my all into making content that other people enjoy, and, more importantly, content that I would enjoy myself. _You can't make other people happy until you are happy with yourself_ (I think).

### When will this all take place?

I'll be releasing some music on July 1st of this year (2022) and from there I'll be releasing tutorial videos every two days, teaching everything from layering vocals, to sidechaining 808s and kicks, to mastering and releasing music that people want to hear. After some time, likely around August or September, I will switch to making higher-quality weekly (or bi-weekly) videos.

### Closing

As always, thanks to all of you for sticking around for this long. I hope to produce content that people will enjoy for years to come, and I've already made some guidelines to follow up until 2026.

See you in July.
