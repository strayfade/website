These FAQ (frequently asked questions) might help you if you have a simple issue that doesn't require reaching out to our support team.

As always, if you have a question which requires further assistance, do not hesitate to join our Discord server and open a ticket. Most tickets are resolved same-day.

### Q: How do I purchase deepaim?
A: Deepaim can be purchased by visiting [deepaim's Sellpass page](https://deepaim.sellpass.io). Sellpass will handle payment processing, and will ask you to pay using either Cryptocurrency or PayPal. You can also pay using credit/debit cards by using the "PayPal" payment option. We also accept Cashapp if you open a ticket in our Discord server. After payment, the license key to access deepaim will be sent to your customer email address.

### Q: Can I get banned for using deepaim?
A: Although deepaim cannot be detected in the same way as normal cheats, it is still possible (but extremely rare) to be banned from in-game player reporting. Deepaim attempts to work **around** the anti-cheats and reduce possible detection vectors.

### Q: Why should I use deepaim instead of a "normal" cheat?
A: First of all, **ZERO** players have ever been banned as a result of deepaim. Deepaim has most of the same options as a normal cheat (Aimbot, Triggerbot, etc.), but it works completely differently.

### Q: I forgot/lost my key, can I get a new one?
A: First, check your email to see if you still have the purchase emails, one of which should have your key in it. If you still have your transaction emails or another proof of purchase, contact our support team by opening a ticket in our Discord server.

### Q: I switched computers, and deepaim says that I can't use my license key. What should I do?
A: Deepaim license keys are HWID-locked to prevent users from sharing keys. If you would like the computer linked to your deepaim license key updated, contact our support team by opening a ticket in our Discord server.

### Q: What are some "best practices" when using deepaim?
A: Here are some good examples of ways to use deepaim:

 - Remember that deepaim license keys' timer doesn't start until they are "activated", or used for the first time.
 - Use a little bit of smoothing (20 to 50 percent)
 - Remember that this is a highly undetectable tournament softaim, not a rage cheat. You still shouldn't be hitting every single shot, even with deepaim.

### Q: Can I get a refund?
A: We may provide refunds **if** you have not used the license key for more than 1 hour. However, we are not required to provide refunds.

### Q: How do I know if deepaim will work on my computer?
A: Check the *"System Requirements"* section on [deepaim's Sellpass page](https://deepaim.sellpass.io) first. Although deepaim will run on a system that meets these requirements, it is recommended to have a GPU that can already run the game itself at 100-150 frames per second for the best experience.

### Q: Do you accept cryptocurrencies?
A: Yes! You can pay using cryptocurrencies on [deepaim's Sellpass page](https://deepaim.sellpass.io).
