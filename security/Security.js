    Helmet can help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately.
    helmet.contentSecurityPolicy which sets the Content-Security-Policy header. This helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks among many other things.
    helmet.hsts which sets the Strict-Transport-Security header. This helps enforce secure (HTTPS) connections to the server.
    helmet.frameguard which sets the X-Frame-Options header. This provides clickjacking protection.

    Using the default session cookie name can open your app to attacks. The security issue posed is similar to X-Powered-By: a potential attacker can use it to fingerprint the server and target attacks accordingly.
