### What is iMessage?

iMessage is the closed-source service used by Apple's "Messages" application to send text messages on Apple devices. Notably, iMessage is only supported on Apple devices, and Apple has attempted to make it difficult to reverse-engineer. This is because some amount of iPhone purchases come from people wishing to use iMessage because of its gatekept feature support.

### Why does this matter?

In the United States, a recent survey determined that 89 percent of teens either already own or expect to purchase an Apple iPhone to use as their primary smartphone. Apple has taken advantage of their market share by taking measures to separate non-Apple smartphone users from iPhone users. This includes changing the color of chat bubbles to signify that the recipient is using a non-Apple product. The main issue, however, is that Apple has been intentionally downgrading the chat experience with non-Apple devices to the SMS standard (in contrast to RCS, the newer messaging standard supported by most of the world).

> ### Update - 9/16/2024
> Apple has enabled support for RCS with the release of iOS 18 to the public, but this version of RCS is still only half-implemented and many features are missing. Nevertheless, this means that Apple is in compliance with the Digital Markets Act.
