### What is iMessage?

iMessage is the closed-source service used by Apple's "Messages" application to send text messages on Apple devices. Notably, iMessage is only supported on Apple devices, and Apple has attempted to make it difficult to reverse-engineer. This is because at least some amount of iPhone purchases come from people wishing to use iMessage because of its gatekept feature support.

### How can we fix this?

Obviously, Apple is not going to release Messages or iMessage-style support for other platforms.
